                    <h4>About Football</h4>
                    <p>Football, also known as association football or soccer, is a global team sport played with a ball
                        between two teams of eleven players</p>
                </div>
                <div id="item-1-1">
                    <h5>Laws of the Game (association football)</h5>
                    <p>The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football. The laws mention the number
                        of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and
                        nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the offside law, and many other laws that define the
                        sport. During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the
                        Game.

                        There were various attempts to codify rules among the various types of football in the mid-19th
                        century. The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly
                        formed Football Association (FA) and written by its first secretary, Ebenezer Cobb Morley. Over
                        time, the Laws have been amended, and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International
                        Football Association Board (IFAB).

                        The Laws are the only rules of association football FIFA permits its members to use.[1] The Laws
                        currently allow some minor optional variations which can be implemented by national football
                        associations, including some for play at the lowest levels, but otherwise almost all organised
                        football worldwide is played under the same ruleset. Within the United States, Major League
                        Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s[2] and the National Federation of State High
                        School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are
                        comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.</p>

                <div id="item-1-2">
                    <h5>International Football Association Board</h5>
                    <p>The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is an international self-regulatory body of
                        association football that is known for determining the Laws of the Game, the regulations for the
                        gameplay of football. It was founded in 1886 in order to establish standardised regulations or
                        "Laws" for the gameplay of international competition, and has since acted as the primary
                        maintainer ("Guardian") of these Laws. FIFA, a prominent governing body for football, has
                        recognised IFAB's jurisdiction over its Laws since its establishment in 1904.[1]

                        IFAB is a distinct body from FIFA, although FIFA is represented on the board and holds 50% of
                        the voting power. The founding football associations of IFAB, England, Scotland, Northern
                        Ireland and Wales each have permanent seats on the organisation. Amendments to the Laws mandate
                        a three-quarter supermajority vote, meaning that FIFA's support is necessary but not sufficient
                        for a motion to pass.

                    <h4>Goalkeeper (association football)</h4>
                    <p> The goalkeeper (sometimes written as goal-keeper, abbreviated as GK, keeper, keeps, or goalie)
                        is a position in association football. It is the most specialised position in the sport.[1] The
                        goalkeeper's main role is to stop the opposing team from scoring a 'goal' (i.e. putting the ball
                        over the goal line). This is accomplished by having the goalkeeper move into the trajectory of
                        the ball to either catch it or direct it further from the vicinity of the goal line. Within the
                        penalty area, goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands, giving them (outside throw-ins) the
                        sole rights on the field to handle the ball. The goalkeeper is indicated by wearing a different
                        coloured kit from their teammates and opposition.

                        The back-pass rule is a rule that disallows handling passes back to keepers from teammates in
                        most cases. Goalkeepers usually perform goal kicks and also give commands to their defense
                        during corner kicks, direct and indirect free kicks, and marking. Goalkeepers play an important
                        role in directing onfield strategy as they have an unrestricted view of the entire pitch, giving
                        them a unique perspective on play development.

                        The goalkeeper is the only mandatory position of a team. If they are injured or sent off,
                        another player must take their place. To replace a goalkeeper who is sent off, a team usually
                        (but is not required to) brings on a substitute keeper in place of an outfield player to ensure
                        they still play an outfield player down. If a team does not have a substitute goalkeeper, or
                        they have already used all of their permitted substitutions for the match, an outfield player
                        has to play as goalkeeper.

                        Because the position requires different skills from the outfielders, goalkeepers train
                        separately from their teammates and often work with a goalkeeping coach to develop their
                        play.[2] While outfielders typically must be in good cardiovascular shape to play up to 90
                        minutes in a match, a goalkeeper must be able to move quickly and have fast feet for little
                        bursts. During a match, goalkeepers may get a lot of action, usually in brief intervals, until
                        their teammates can clear the ball out of the zone. During practice, goalkeepers focus heavily
                        on footwork and being able to get up quickly after a save is made. A goalkeeper must be able to
                        get set, meaning feet shoulder width apart and on their toes, before the next shot comes their
                        way, so they can react and make the save.[3]

                        As with all players, goalkeepers may wear any squad number, but the number 1 is almost always
                        reserved for a team's first-choice goalkeeper, and the number 13 for the second-choice or backup
                        goalkeeper.

                        The goalkeeper is notably the only position that is not included in formations. This is because
                        the goalkeeper is the only non-outfielder position and the only compulsory position in football.

                        Though not essential, goalkeepers are typically tall players due to the height of the goal and
                        the number of crosses, corners, and high shots in football.</p>

                    <h4>Penalty area</h4>
                    <p> The penalty area or 18-yard box (also known less formally as the penalty box or simply box) is
                        an area of an association football pitch. It is rectangular and extends 18 yd (16 m) to each
                        side of the goal and 18 yd (16 m) in front of it. If any part of the ball is over any part of a
                        line demarking the penalty area then the ball is considered to be inside the penalty area.
                        Within the penalty area is the penalty spot, which is 12 yd (11 m) from the goal line, directly
                        in line with the centre of the goal. A penalty arc (often informally called "the D") adjoins the
                        penalty area, and encloses the area within 10 yd (9.1 m) of the penalty spot. It does not form
                        part of the penalty area and is only of relevance during the taking of a penalty kick, when any
                        players inside the arc are adjudged to be encroaching.[1] Within the penalty area is another
                        smaller rectangular area called the goal area (colloquially the "six-yard box"), which is
                        delimited by two lines starting on the goal-line 6 yd (5.5 m) from the goalposts and extending 6
                        yd (5.5 m) into the pitch from the goal-line, and the line joining these. Goal kicks and any
                        free kick by the defending team may be taken from anywhere in this area. Indirect free kicks
                        awarded to the attacking team within the goal area are taken from the point on the line parallel
                        to the goal line (the "six-yard line") nearest where the infringement occurred; they cannot be
                        taken any closer to the goal line. Similarly drop-balls that would otherwise occur closer to the
                        goal line are taken on this line. Previously, penalty areas extended across the full width of
                        the field; they were reduced to their current dimensions in 1901.

                    <h5>Tie (draw)</h5>
                    <p>In other areas, such as in a vote, there may be a method to break the tie. Having an odd number
                        of voters is one solution—after the election of the Doge of Venice by a committee of 40 was
                        deadlocked in a tie, the number of electors was increased to 41—but may not always be
                        successful, for example, if a member is absent or abstains, or if there are more than two
                        candidates. In many cases one member of an assembly may by convention not normally vote, but
                        will exercise a casting vote in case of deadlock. Sometimes some method of random choice, such
                        as tossing a coin, may be resorted to, even in a formal vote.[1]

                        In some legislative bodies, a casting vote can only be exercised according to strict rules or
                        constitutional conventions. For example, the Speaker of the British House of Commons (a position
                        whose functions and conventions of operation inspire similar roles in several other nations
                        using the Westminster system) is expected by convention to follow Speaker Denison's rule (i.e.
                        to vote to allow further discussion, if this is possible, and otherwise to vote in favour of the
                        status quo). This in effect means "Yes/Yea/Aye" on the first and second reading of a bill,
                        "No/Nay" on the third, "Yes/Yea/Aye" on the government's budget, and "No/Nay" on a motion of no
                        confidence.</p>

                    <h5>Team sport</h5>
                    <p>A team sport is a type of sport where the fundamental nature of the game or sport requires the
                        participation of multiple individuals working together as a team, and it is inherently
                        impossible or highly impractical to execute the sport as a single-player endeavour. In team
                        sports, the cooperative effort of team members is essential for the sport to function and
                        achieve its objectives. The objective often involves teammates facilitating the movement of a
                        ball or similar bob in accordance with a set of rules in order to score points. Examples are
                        basketball, volleyball, rugby league, rugby union, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket,
                        baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey. These sports emphasize teamwork,
                        strategy, and coordination among team members while competing against opposing teams to achieve
                        a common goal.[1] Team sports do not include individual or individual-to-team events within a
                        sport.</p>
